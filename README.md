# CommonTasksAutomation
Programming or scripting to automate repetitive or time-consuming tasks that would typically be done manually using a software application. This can include tasks such as data entry, data manipulation, report generation, file management, or even actions within a specific software application like web scraping, sending emails, automated testing, scheduling tasks, and more. The goal  is to improve efficiency, reduce errors and save time.

- Web scraping: Rotten Tomatoes, this project is about web scrapping using the `BeautifulSoup`. The objective is extracting data points, create a list with them in a tabular format and save it as an excel and a csv file.

- File management: Big Data & Analytics Master Program, here the objective was to create folders replicating the program structure (field of study > Courses > Topics). To accomplish that I created the program structure in an excel file and them a Python script using `os` and `Pandas` libraries to create the folders and subfolder in my local directory.
